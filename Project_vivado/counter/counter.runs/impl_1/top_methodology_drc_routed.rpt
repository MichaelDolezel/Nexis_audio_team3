2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PWM/s_data3_reg[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) driver_seg_4/s_data3_reg[0]/PRE, driver_seg_4/s_data3_reg[2]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PWM/s_data4_reg[0]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) driver_seg_4/s_data4_reg[0]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PWM/s_data4_reg[0]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) driver_seg_4/s_data3_reg[3]/CLR, driver_seg_4/s_data4_reg[0]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PWM/s_data7_reg[3]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) driver_seg_4/s_data3_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
